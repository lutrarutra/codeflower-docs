## v0.11.0

*2026-11-01*

- Connections to sandboxes are encrypted when their line has a fingerprint; the page marks a sandbox without one as unencrypted.
- Links an agent asks you to open must be web pages, and the dialog shows where they go.
- An interactive report that loads another page in its place is stopped. For a sandbox with an isolated network, reports open without their scripts unless you ask.
- Through the tunnel, the browser's key can no longer be read out of the browser.
- The agent's sign-in and plugins appear in each sandbox's card under Server, and starting sandboxes through the tunnel shows as locked, with the setting that allows it.
- Reports in the chat use the brand's fonts.

## v0.10.0

*2026-11-01*

- Through the tunnel, the app's page shows the sandboxes of every paired computer, grouped by computer in the sidebar; chats from all of them open side by side and in Focus. A computer that stops answering keeps its sandboxes and chats listed, greyed, until it is back.
- Focus connects to the next chat's sandbox ahead, and a chat whose connection was closed reconnects as soon as you look at it.

## v0.9.0

*2026-11-01*

- A Plugins view for the agent's own plugins, in VS Code and the app's window.
- The Focus view of the app's window.
- The file editor fills its tab, with line numbers at the edge, as in VS Code.

## v0.8.0

*2026-11-01*

- The chat's colours and fonts are now shared with this documentation site. The chat looks as before.

## v0.7.0

*2026-11-01*

The first release documented on this site. For earlier changes, see the [repository's history](https://github.com/lutrarutra/codeflower-ui/tags).
